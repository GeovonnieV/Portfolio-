<h1>About Me</h1>


    <p>I am Geovonnie Vasquez, I was born and raised in Arlington Texas.
        My hobbies are weightlifting, playing video games, and watching stand up comedy.
        I like weightlifting beacause it helps improve my health and gives me 
        new goals to achieve. Playing video games help me escape reality. 
        Somtimes life can be stressful and I like to play my favorite game (call of duty)
        to take a break from obstacles. Most of all I love to laugh. stand up comics are genius,
        I think its amazing how somone can talk to a large group of people
        that dont talk back for 2 hours and make them laugh.
        I watch a wide varitey of comedians to help improve my 
        communication skills. I feel this day in age lacks
        people skills that effect our every day and professional lives.

    My dream is to manage a devlopment team. Ive played
    football all my life until junior year in high school when I 
    got my 1st after school job at chipotle. I miss motivating and working
    with a team to succeed. We all had a special relationship knowing we 
    been though the same sacrafices and training to get where we are,
    coding brings those same experiences.
    I dont have alot of coding experience yet but I do have alot of ambition.
    I know the game plan to achieve my goals and im willing to do what it takes.
